**Important: the actively developed RM-tools directory has moved.**
RM-tools can now be found at https://github.com/CIRADA-Tools/RM
Further development of RM-tools will take place in that repository, so all feature requests, bug reports, and other communication should be done there.
This repository will no longer be updated, and represents the state of RM-tools development as of May 2019.

NOTE:
The master and develop branches of RM-tools are no longer being actively maintained.
The cirada branch has been updated to Python 3; the master branch has been left for Python 2 compatability but will not receive updates except for critial bugs (at our discretion).

Questions, bug reports, and feature requests can be sent to Cameron Van Eck, cameron.van.eck (at) dunlap.utoronto.ca.

More information on the Canadian Initiative for Radio Astronomy Data Analysis (CIRADA) can be found at cirada.org.
